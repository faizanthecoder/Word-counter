  <h1>About CountIt4U</h1>
  <p><strong>CountIt4U</strong> is a free, intelligent, and easy-to-use online writing assistant designed for students, content creators, and professionals who want precision in their words. We built this tool to simplify the writing process by combining key functions — word counting, character tracking, keyword analysis, and instant grammar support — in one clean interface.</p>
  
  <p>CountIt4U helps users track their writing progress while maintaining quality and readability. Whether you're preparing an essay, an email, a blog post, or a research paper, this tool ensures that every word counts — literally. You can view total words, characters, spaces, keyword density, and estimated reading time in real-time.</p>
  
  <h2>Our Mission</h2>

We believe everyone should have access to smart, ad-supported tools that improve productivity without compromising privacy. That’s why <strong>CountIt4U</strong> runs completely in your browser — your data stays private, always.</p>

  <h2>Why We Built It</h2>
